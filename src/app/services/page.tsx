                I offer deeply focused, brain-friendly software psychic sessions designed for neurodivergent professionals. My approach comes from a place of deep inner knowledge and connected insights from my background in sociology, civics, politics, and human rights. I don't want clients who want me to solve their problems‚ÄîI want clients who want to solve their own problems but need a hand in bringing their vision to life. My pattern recognition makes often unsettling connections across industries that have historically gatekept knowledge, and my recommendations come from this place of deep understanding. Creation and ideation are spiritual processes, and I find it's helpful to combine the spiritual and the technical to get at the heart of what a business, founder, or business owner needs in a lasting way.
