### Service Description
**Software Psychic Sessions** with the Pythoness Programmer - I don't solve your problemsâ€”I help you solve your own. Through my unique blend of technical expertise, pattern recognition, and spiritual insight, I guide you to bring your vision to life. My approach comes from a place of deep inner knowledge and connected insights from my background in sociology, civics, politics, and human rights. I make unsettling connections across industries that have historically gatekept knowledge, and my recommendations come from this place of deep understanding. With 3 years of software engineering experience and 10+ years in communications, customer service, and business operations, I understand how businesses actually work and how systems are designed to succeed or fail. Creation and ideation are spiritual processes, and I combine the mystical with the practical to get at the heart of what your business truly needs.
