## Meet Martha

The Rye Sourdough Starter established May 2024 in New Kent, Virginia

Cultivated using Joshua Weissman's Ultimate Sourdough Starter Guide

## WTF do I do with this starter?

You probably received about 50g of my sourdough starter in a Mason jar. The jar is the ideal vessel for feeding your new starter, which came from my rye starter Martha.

- Martha loves Organic Rye Flour, so if she doesn't rise or was in the fridge for a month and needs a refresh, feed her with a mix of rye flour!
- If you're not ready to feed it right away, place it in the fridge.

### How to feed Martha:
Martha likes the typical 1:2:2 ratioâ€”for every 1 part of starter, add 2 parts flour and 2 parts water.
- So for the starter you received from Amanda, add 100g flour and 100g of lukewarm water (50g:100g:100g).
- To avoid killing the active yeasts, don't use hot water or bleached flours when feeding.
- When the starter is sitting out on the counter or being brought to room temperature, keep the metal band around the Mason jar loose to prevent forming a seal. Make sure it's sealed when resting in the fridge.

## Basic Feeding Schedule

### For an Active Starter (Room Temperature):
- Feed once every 12-24 hours using the 1:2:2 ratio (50g starter + 100g flour + 100g water)
- Best time to use in recipes: 4-8 hours after feeding, when starter has doubled and is bubbly
- Keep jar loosely covered at room temperature (65-75Â°F)

### For Maintenance Mode (Refrigerated):
- Feed once before refrigerating
- Store in refrigerator for up to 2 weeks between feedings
- When ready to bake again:
  - Remove from fridge and let sit at room temperature for 2 hours
  - Feed and wait 4-8 hours until active
  - Feed one more time if starter seems sluggish

## Signs Your Starter is Healthy:
- Doubles in size after feeding
- Smells pleasantly sour (like yogurt or beer)
- Has consistent bubbles throughout

## "Starter" Sourdough Terms

- **Starter** - A fermented mixture of flour and water that contains wild yeast and beneficial bacteria. It's used as a natural leavening agent instead of commercial yeast.
- **Feeding** - The process of adding fresh flour and water to your starter to keep the microorganisms alive and active. Typically done using specific ratios (like 1:2:2).
- **Discard** - The portion of starter removed before feeding to maintain a manageable quantity. Can be used in various recipes rather than throwing away.
- **Hydration** - The ratio of water to flour in your starter or dough, usually expressed as a percentage.
- **Active/Ripe** - When your starter is most active, usually 4-8 hours after feeding, showing lots of bubbles and approximately doubling in size.

## Baking Terminology

- **Levain** - A portion of starter specifically built for a recipe, sometimes with different flour types or ratios than your regular starter.
- **Lamination** - A technique where dough is folded repeatedly to create layers, resulting in improved structure and texture. Often used for pastries but also beneficial for some sourdough breads.
- **Inclusions** - Additional ingredients incorporated into bread dough such as nuts, seeds, dried fruits, herbs, or cheese that add flavor, texture, and visual appeal.
- **Autolyse** - A rest period where flour and water are mixed and left to sit before adding starter and salt, allowing for better flour hydration and gluten development.
- **Bulk Fermentation** - The first rise of the dough after mixing all ingredients, where the majority of fermentation happens, typically lasting 4-12 hours depending on temperature.
- **Stretch and Fold** - A gentle dough handling technique that builds strength without excessive kneading, involving stretching the dough and folding it over itself periodically during bulk fermentation.
- **Scoring** - Cutting the surface of bread dough before baking to control how it expands and creates an attractive pattern.
- **Crumb** - The interior texture of bread, which can be described as open (with large holes), tight, or anything in between.

## Amanda's Favorite Flours and Tools

### Flours
- King Arthur Organic Rye Flour â€” this is what I used to make the starter from scratch
- Any non-bleached all-purpose flour â€” King Arthur is usually the brand I reach for. Generic all-purpose flours don't work as well when feeding the starter, though they're perfectly fine for recipes.
- Any non-bleached bread flour â€” currently I've been getting the generic brand at Costco

### Tools

- OXO Airtight Flour Storage (what I'm slowly saving up for my baking items) - [Amazon Link](https://amzn.to/4bt23WF)

2. Let stand for 2 hours covered.
3. Add salt and stretch and fold the dough over on itself for 3-4 minutes. The dough will start to become more formed together.
4. Let stand for 2 hours covered.
5. Divide the dough into 2, and form two loaves with tension.
6. Cover the loaves and let them rest in the fridge for at least 1 hour to overnight.
7. Form the resting loaves into loaves again. (This is the time to add any inclusions or fillings to the dough)
8. Bake at 450ÂºF for 30min covered and 20min uncovered in a dutch oven, or loaf pan covered in foil.

### Discard - Buttermilk Biscuits

- 270g all-purpose flour
- 2 TB baking powder
- 1 tsp salt

#### Method:
1. Preheat oven to 425ÂºF
2. Mix all ingredients except butter (and 1 TB of buttermilk) to form a dough.
3. Add grated butter and roughly form dough.
4. Laminate the dough by folding the dough over itself at least 3 times before cutting out biscuit shapes.
