# Sourdough Baking Guide

## Getting Started

Welcome to the wonderful world of sourdough baking! This guide will help you understand the basics and get you started with your first loaf.

### What is Sourdough?

Sourdough is a naturally leavened bread that uses wild yeasts and bacteria instead of commercial yeast. The starter is a mixture of flour and water that captures wild yeasts from the environment, creating a living culture that makes your bread rise.

### Creating Your Starter

1. Day 1: Mix 50g flour and 50g water in a clean jar
2. Day 2: Discard half, add 50g flour and 50g water
3. Day 3-7: Repeat daily until bubbly and active
4. Feed twice daily when active

- Dutch oven or baking stone
- Digital scale
- Banneton (proofing basket)
