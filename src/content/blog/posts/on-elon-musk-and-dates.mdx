# Pythoness Perspective: On Elon Musk and Dates

## "I'm not just concerned - I'm alarmed" - yeah please quote me on that.

Hey there, cosmic coders and stargazers!

Buckle up, because we're about to dive into a tech drama more explosive than a supernova. Grab your favorite mug of something strong, because we're going to need it as we unravel a situation that's got this code witch's alarm bells ringing louder than a midnight deployment gone wrong.

## The "150-Year-Old Social Security Recipients" Saga: More Than Just a Glitch

So, Elon Musk recently claimed that Social Security is paying out to people older than the lightbulb. But this isn't just a quirky misunderstanding - it's a dangerous spread of misinformation that we need to talk about.

## The Technical Reality

Let's break it down:

1. Social Security runs on COBOL, an ancient programming language designed for basic systems. This was _the_ programming language of the 60s.
2. COBOL doesn't do dates well. It's like trying to teach your grandma to use TikTok.
3. The ISO 8601 date standard starts on May 20th, 1875 per the international treaty known as the Treaty of the Metre. This exact date serves as a starting point for calendar date tracking via only digits. "ISO" refers to the non-governmental "International Organization for Standardization". Not all engineers use the same standards, which can cause issues exactly like this one.
4. When these systems need to have a number in the system, and the data of birth may not be known exactly it is likely left blank and it is defaulted to 1875 by a system that views "0" or null as May 20th, 1875.

For a comprehensive breakdown of the technical details and conventions behind this issue, I highly recommend watching the video by CJ Trowbridge (they/them) on TikTok. In just 2 minutes and 45 seconds, CJ provides an in-depth explanation that will help you fully grasp the technical nuances of this situation.

## Why This is Scarier Than a Blue Screen of Death

As a software engineer, _**I'm not just concerned - I'm alarmed**_. Here's why:

1. **Platform Power**: Musk owns X (formerly Twitter). Imagine if your database admin suddenly decided to rewrite reality, Musk continues to do this every day he is allowed in DC with his team of 20-somethings.
2. **Tech Illiteracy in High Places**: When powerful figures misunderstand (or misrepresent) tech, it's like giving a toddler security clearance. (Which by the way, Musk does not have himself.)
3. **Erosion of Trust**: False tech claims undermine public trust in critical systems. It's like telling everyone that the pandemic is overâ€¦ oh wait.

## The Cosmic Takeaway

1. **Stay Vigilant**: When tech claims sound off, channel your inner code detective.
2. **Speak Up**: We've got the knowledge. It's time to use it to call out dangerous misinformation.
3. **Educate Others**: Share your tech wisdom like it's the hottest gossip in the coding cosmos.

Remember, in this vast dataverse, we're not just reading code - we're guardians of digital truth. So let's use our powers for good, shall we?

Keep your code clean, your facts checked, and your BS detectors finely tuned. Until next time, may your logic be sound and your integrity unbreakable!

Yours in algorithms and accountability,  
Your Favorite Pythoness
