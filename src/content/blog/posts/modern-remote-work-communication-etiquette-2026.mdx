# Modern Communication Etiquette for Remote Work in 2026

## The Camera-On Expectation Is Unreasonable

Let's be direct: expecting people to keep their cameras on during meetings is aggressive. In 2026, we need to recognize that event planners and meeting organizers are not entitled to other people's faces and reactions.

Here's what's happening: people are being asked to perform visibility in ways that drain energy, invade privacy, and create unnecessary cognitive load. Your face, your reactions, your background—these aren't meeting requirements. They're personal choices.

### Why Camera Requirements Are Problematic

**Energy and Cognitive Load:**
- Maintaining "camera presence" requires constant self-monitoring
- People are managing their appearance, background, lighting, and facial expressions
- This mental overhead pulls focus from the actual meeting content
- For many, this performance is exhausting

**Privacy and Autonomy:**
- Your home is not a public space
- People deserve control over when and how they're visible
- Backgrounds reveal personal information about living situations
- Not everyone has a dedicated office space or professional setup

**Accessibility and Inclusion:**
- Some people process information better without visual distractions
- Neurodivergent individuals may find camera-on requirements overwhelming
- Bandwidth limitations make video participation difficult or impossible
- People may need to manage sensory input in ways that aren't visible

**The Reality of 2026:**
- We've been doing remote work long enough to know what works
- Audio participation is valid and effective
- Trust your team to engage without visual proof
- Focus on meeting outcomes, not visual presence

## Every Meeting Needs an Agenda

This applies to both in-person and remote meetings: if you're calling a meeting, you need an agenda. Period.

### Why Agendas Are Non-Negotiable

**Respect for Time:**
- People are giving you their time—the least you can do is prepare
- Agendas help attendees prepare and contribute meaningfully
- Clear structure prevents meetings from derailing
- Time-boxed topics keep meetings focused and efficient

**Accessibility:**
- Agendas allow people to prepare questions or materials in advance
- People can determine if their presence is actually needed
- Clear structure helps with attention and processing
- Agendas make meetings more inclusive for different communication styles

**Accountability:**
- Agendas create clear expectations for what will be covered
- They help track whether meetings achieved their goals
- Action items are easier to identify when structure is clear
- Follow-up becomes more straightforward

### What a Good Agenda Includes

- **Purpose:** Why are we meeting? What decision needs to be made?
- **Topics:** What will we discuss? In what order?
- **Time allocation:** How long for each topic?
- **Preparation:** What should attendees review or bring?
- **Desired outcomes:** What do we need to accomplish?

If you can't create an agenda, question whether you need the meeting at all. Could this be an email? A Slack thread? A shared document?

## Setting New Standards

### For Meeting Organizers

**Do:**
- Send agendas at least 24 hours in advance
- Make camera participation optional and clearly stated
- Start meetings by acknowledging that cameras are optional
- Focus on meeting outcomes, not visual presence
- Respect when people choose audio-only participation
- Create space for different communication styles

**Don't:**
- Require cameras to be on
- Comment on people's backgrounds or appearance
- Assume camera-off means disengagement
- Make people justify why their camera is off
- Use visual presence as a measure of participation

### For Participants

**You have the right to:**
- Keep your camera off without explanation
- Participate fully via audio
- Protect your privacy and energy
- Set boundaries around visibility
- Request agendas for meetings you're invited to
- Decline meetings that don't have clear purpose or structure

**You can:**
- Let organizers know you'll be audio-only
- Request agendas if they're missing
- Suggest alternatives to meetings without clear purpose
- Advocate for better meeting practices in your organization

## The Shift We Need

Remote work in 2026 means we've had years to learn what actually works. The practices that made sense in 2020—when we were all figuring it out—don't need to persist forever.

**What we've learned:**
- Audio participation is effective
- Agendas make meetings better for everyone
- Visual presence doesn't equal engagement
- Trust and outcomes matter more than visibility
- People need autonomy over their participation

**What needs to change:**
- Stop requiring cameras
- Start requiring agendas
- Focus on meeting outcomes, not visual proof
- Respect people's boundaries and energy
- Build trust through results, not surveillance

## Moving Forward

If you're organizing meetings, ask yourself:
- Do I have a clear agenda?
- Am I making camera participation optional?
- Am I focusing on outcomes or appearances?
- Am I respecting people's time and energy?

If you're participating in meetings, remember:
- Your camera is your choice
- You deserve agendas and preparation time
- Your participation is valid regardless of visibility
- You can set boundaries around meeting expectations

The future of remote work is about respect, trust, and effectiveness—not about forcing people to perform visibility or accepting poorly structured meetings. Let's build communication practices that actually work for everyone.
