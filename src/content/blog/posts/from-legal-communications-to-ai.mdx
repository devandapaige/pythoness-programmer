# From Legal Communications to AI: How My Background in Law Keeps Me Afloat in the Deep Ocean of AI

My experience as a Claims Analyst at a law firm became my anchor in the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence. This journey from legal communications to AI transformed how I approach technology—making it more human, more accessible, and yes, even joyful.

## The Foundation: Legal Communications and Claims Analysis

Legal communications taught me that precision and attention to detail serve a deeper purpose: building trust and clarity. As a Claims Analyst, I processed complex legal documents with care, creating systems that protected sensitive information while building bridges between stakeholders. This work created order in chaos, found clarity in complexity.

## The Evolution: Communications Coordinator

The Communications Coordinator role revealed my passion for crafting systems that made sense. Setting up workflows for recall settlements and managing inbound calls became my first taste of engineering. I discovered the joy of creating clear pathways for information, designing solutions that reduced friction, and leading teams with purpose. Each day brought new challenges and opportunities to make technology work for people.

## The Pivot: From Law to Tech

The coding bootcamp experience became my bridge to the tech industry years later. The structured learning environment, combined with my background in creating order from complexity, gave me a unique advantage. My ability to break down complex problems and communicate clearly helped me not just survive the bootcamp—it helped me thrive. This foundation led me to an Amazon company, where I applied these skills in a new context: building and scaling technology solutions.

## The Unexpected Connection: AI and Legal Communications

ChatGPT's launch in late 2022, just before my big tech layoff, revealed something powerful. My legal communications skills became my secret weapon in the AI era. The ability to guide conversations with purpose, maintain focus on what matters, and create clarity in complexity—these skills became essential tools for building bridges between technology and human needs.

## The Deep Ocean of AI

Today, I navigate the deep ocean of AI with confidence, drawing on these foundational skills daily. I structure conversations that serve their purpose, maintain context in complex discussions, and create clarity where there's confusion. It's about guiding AI interactions toward meaningful outcomes that serve real human needs.

## The Takeaway

Technology should serve humans, not the other way around. The attention to detail, communication skills, and process management abilities I developed in the legal field became my compass in tech. They help me create AI solutions that are accessible to everyone, joyful to use, and anxiety-reducing. Most importantly, they keep the human element at the center of every technological interaction.

As we explore AI's possibilities, I'm grateful for this unconventional path. It's shown me that the most valuable skills often come from unexpected places—and that technology works best when it serves people, not the other way around.
