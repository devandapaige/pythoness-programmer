As I reflect on my journey with productivity tools, I'm reminded that technology is neither inherently good nor evil. It's a tool. And like any tool, its impact depends on how we use it. Some view tech as a source of negativity or anxiety, but I believe it can be a powerful ally in enhancing our lives.

## Revisiting Old Tools with Fresh Eyes

Recently, I returned to two tools I'd previously abandoned: [Sunsama](https://sunsama.com/share?refId=67b613788d8ce50001d86512) and Notion. At one point, they felt overwhelming, but now they're integral to my workflow. Sunsama helps me plan and reflect, aligning tasks with my energy cycles. Notion, despite its imperfections, serves as a reliable note-taking and database solution, syncing seamlessly with Sunsama.

**The Lesson**: Tools evolve, and so do we. What didn't serve us before might fit perfectly now. **_And that's worth exploring._**

## How Tech Can Enhance Positive Energy

Here are some ways I've reframed my relationship with tech to reduce anxiety and amplify positive energy:

1. **Energy-Based Planning**: Align tasks with your natural energy cycles. High-energy mornings? That's when you tackle deep work. Low-energy afternoons? Perfect for admin tasks or creative brainstorming.
2. **Mindful Tool Selection**: Not every tool is for everyone. And that's okay! The key is finding tools that feel intuitive and supportive for you. If something feels like friction rather than flow, ask yourself: Is this tool serving me, or am I serving it?
3. **Boundaries Are Everything**: Notifications off. Social media muted when needed. Clear start-and-stop times for work tools like email or Slack. These boundaries help you stay present and prevent tech from draining your energy.
4. **Experimentation Without Fear**: Tech isn't static. It's playful! Treat your workflow as an experiment rather than a rigid system. Try new tools or revisit old ones without judgment; you might stumble upon something transformative.

## For Those Who See Tech as "Evil"

If you view tech as a source of negativity or anxiety, I invite you to reconsider. Instead of seeing technology as an enemy, let's try viewing it as neutral energy waiting to be directed by your intentions.

* Ask Yourself: Is this tool adding value to my life? If not, why am I using it?
* Take Control: Set boundaries around how and when you engage with tech.
* Find the Fun: Explore ways tech can support hobbies or passions. Whether that's tracking your garden growth in an app or using AI to brainstorm creative projects.

## The Bigger Picture: Building Resilience Through Tech

Technology doesn't have to be overwhelming. It can be grounding when approached mindfully. By understanding the tools we use and aligning them with our needs, we can turn tech into a partner in enhancing our lives rather than a source of stress.

Remember: You're in charge here. Not the algorithms or notifications vying for your attention.

So go ahead. Revisit that app you swore off years ago or try something new entirely. You might just find that what once felt like chaos now feels like calm. A tool ready to amplify your positive energy.
