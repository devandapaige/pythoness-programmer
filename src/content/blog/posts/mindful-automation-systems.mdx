# Mindful Automation Systems: Creating Digital Workflows That Serve You

## Building Automation That Supports Rather Than Controls

Hey there,

I'm excited to dive into energy awareness with you this week. After years of working with my brain's natural rhythms, I've discovered how this understanding transforms automation from a source of stress into a tool for sustainable productivity.

_(fyi - Some external links may be referral codes that will benefit my art if used.)_

## Main Feature: The Energy-Based Automation Schedule

When I first started automating tasks, I scheduled everything based on "best practices" rather than my actual energy patterns. The result? Missed deadlines, system failures, and increased anxiety. Here's how I learned to create an energy-aware automation system:

### Understanding Your Energy Patterns

Before setting up any automation, I map my energy levels throughout the day. Here's my simple process:

1. **Track Your Energy**: Look at the data you're already collecting! Many of us are already tracking our energy patterns without realizing it:
   * Check your habit tracker apps (like [Finch](https://finchcare.com/)) for energy level history
   * Review your calendar for patterns in when you schedule different types of tasks
   * Look at your fitness/health tracker data for energy and activity patterns
   * Consider your existing journal entries or morning pages for energy insights

2. **Identify Patterns**: Look for consistent high and low energy periods
3. **Match Tasks to Energy**: Schedule automated tasks based on when you have the energy to handle them

_My Story_: I need a slow morning to properly wake up and get my brain going. That's why I start my day with morning pages and coffee - it's my way of gently unlocking my brain for the day ahead.

I've discovered that I need a significant break in the afternoon, so I take 3-4 hours off to recharge. During this time, I do lower-energy tasks like cooking or administrative work - things that don't require deep thinking. This led me to restructure my work schedule:

* Noon to 3-4 PM: First work block
* 3-4 PM to 5-6 PM: Break and recharge
* 5-6 PM to 8-9 PM: Second work block

**But here's the crucial part:** I've also learned to set strict boundaries around my energy patterns. Even if I'm in a creative flow or feeling energetic after my "clock out" time, I have automation systems in place to help me maintain these boundaries. For example, my office lights automatically turn off at my scheduled end time - I'd have to deliberately tell my smart home system to turn them back on if I wanted to work longer.

### Creating Energy-Aware Automations

The key to sustainable automation is creating workflows that support your best work. Here's my approach:

**Making High-Energy Periods More Valuable** When I'm in my high-energy periods, I focus on the work that matters most. I use automation to:

* Block off dedicated time for deep work (like writing this newsletter)
* Create clear boundaries around my high-energy periods
* Remove friction from my creative process

_Real Example_: When I need to write my newsletter, I create a complete workflow:

1. Block off an hour in my [Cal.com](https://cal.com/) calendar (this prevents others from scheduling meetings)
2. If I can't write during that time, I can easily move the block to another high-energy period
3. The calendar block creates a natural pause in my other workflows
4. I've automated the first step (creating a new page in Obsidian) to reduce friction
5. This triggers my content creation workflow, including AI assistance

**Pro-Tip**: The most valuable automation creates space for your best work. For example:

* Calendar blocks that protect your high-energy periods
* Automated reminders that help you transition between tasks
* Systems that reduce the friction of starting important work

## Quick Tip: The Energy-Based Automation Schedule

Instead of trying to automate everything, focus on creating workflows that support your natural energy patterns. Here's how I structure my day:

**Morning (Low Energy)**
* Morning pages and coffee (no automation needed, just space to wake up)
* Review calendar and adjust blocks if needed
* Set up my workspace for the day

**First Work Block (High Energy)**
* Deep work tasks (writing, coding, complex problem-solving)
* No unscheduled meetings or interruptions, usually at my desk
* Automated "do not disturb" mode on computer
* Clear boundaries around this time

**Afternoon Break (Low Energy)**
* Administrative tasks
* Cooking or meal prep
* Light reading or research
* No pressure to be "productive"

**Second Work Block (High Energy)**
* Creative work
* Content creation
* Project planning
* Automated reminders to wrap up at a specific time

## Tool Spotlight: From Workflow Thinking to Automation

Now that you're thinking in terms of if/then workflows, let's explore how to identify where automation can truly make a difference. Here's a key insight: automation isn't about replacing your human workflow - it's about supporting it.

**The Human Part (No Automation Needed)**
* Writing the newsletter content
* Reviewing and editing
* Adding personal touches
* Making creative decisions

**The Post-Creation Automation (Where Automation Shines)**
Once my newsletter is written and reviewed, that's when automation becomes valuable. Here's what I'm automating:

1. **Formatting and Distribution**
   * Converting my markdown to HTML for Beehiiv
   * Creating the Substack version
   * Creating ideas for short and longform content
   * Setting up the proper formatting for each platform
   * Scheduling the sends

2. **Cross-Platform Publishing**
   * Posting to my website
   * Creating social media snippets
   * Setting up email sequences
   * Tracking analytics

## Community Corner: Beyond Work - Automation in Daily Life

As we explore energy-aware automation, I want to reflect on how these principles transform our daily lives and home management. The same if/then thinking and friction reduction that helps us in our professional workflows creates space for what matters most in our personal lives.

Think about it: How many mental reminders are you carrying around for home maintenance tasks? When was the last time you changed your air filter? Does your refrigerator need a new water filter? When should you schedule the annual power washing? These aren't just tasks - they're energy drains that take up valuable mental space.

When we automate or create clear workflows for home maintenance, we create mental space for connection, creativity, and community.

## Personal Update: My Energy-Aware Journey

This week, I've been focusing on simplifying my automation systems. Here's what I've learned:

**Workflow First, Automation Second**
I focus on creating clear workflows that work with my natural energy patterns. For me, this means:

* Taking time for morning pages and coffee
* Working in focused blocks during my high-energy periods
* Taking that crucial afternoon break
* Returning to work in the evening when my energy returns

**Identifying the Real Friction Points**
The biggest shift in my thinking has been learning to identify where automation adds value. I now ask:

* Where does my human workflow flow naturally?
* What tasks take me out of my creative flow?
* Which repetitive tasks could be handled by automation?
* How can I create more space for what matters most?

**Creating Space for Connection**
The most surprising discovery has been how reducing friction in both work and home life creates space for deeper connections. When I'm not constantly tracking maintenance tasks or worrying about distribution workflows, I have more energy for:

* Meaningful conversations
* Creative projects
* Community engagement
* Personal growth

Remember, the goal is to create systems that work with your brain's natural rhythms. Start by observing your energy patterns, then build your automation around them. And most importantly, remember that automation should serve your life, not the other way around.

Next week, we'll explore how to error-proof your automation systems, take a closer look at tools like [Make.com](https://make.com/), and discuss how to mindfully integrate these powerful (and reliable!) automations into your overall workflow. Until then, I encourage you to look at your own workflows - both at work and at home - and identify where reducing friction could create more space for what matters most to you.
