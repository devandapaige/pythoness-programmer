# Digital Accessibility Legal Guide: Your Starting Point for Compliance

## Why Every Business Owner Needs This Resource

If you've ever thought, "I had no idea my website could expose me to legal liability," you're not alone. Many business owners discover digital accessibility requirements through unfortunate circumstances—receiving a demand letter, facing litigation, or watching competitors deal with legal challenges.

The reality is stark: **15% of the global population has some form of disability.** When your digital presence isn't accessible, you're not only excluding potential customers—you're potentially exposing your business to legal liability that could threaten its viability.

## What You'll Find in the Digital Accessibility Legal Guide

Our [Digital Accessibility Legal Guide](/accessibility) is a comprehensive starting point designed specifically for business owners who need to understand:

- **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1:** Technical standards used by courts to assess compliance
- **Case Law Analysis:** Examination of actual litigation outcomes and their implications for businesses of all sizes

### Practical Implementation Framework

## Why This Guide is Different

This resource goes beyond basic accessibility checklists by combining technical expertise with practical business insights. As a Senior Software Engineer with over 13 years of experience and a neurodivergent perspective, I provide a starting point that bridges the gap between legal requirements and human-centered implementation.

## Getting Started

Ready to begin your accessibility journey? The [Digital Accessibility Legal Guide](/accessibility) is completely free and designed to be your starting point for understanding and implementing digital accessibility compliance.

**Remember:** Don't try to fix everything at once. Pick one issue from your test results and focus on that until it's completely resolved. Small, consistent improvements are more sustainable than overwhelming overhauls.

The goal is awareness, not perfection. Every business owner finds accessibility issues on their first test—that's completely normal and fixable.

## Why Accessibility Matters Beyond Compliance

While legal compliance is important, accessibility also provides significant business benefits:

- **Market Access:** Accessible design enables engagement with 15% of the global population—that's 1.1 billion potential customers
- **Search Engine Optimization:** Accessible websites receive preferential treatment in search rankings
- **Reputation Management:** Proactive compliance prevents costly reputation damage
- **Competitive Differentiation:** Most businesses remain non-compliant, creating opportunities for market leadership

Studies show that accessibility improvements typically pay for themselves within 6-12 months through increased market reach, improved SEO, and reduced legal risk.
