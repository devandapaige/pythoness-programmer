# Digital Spring Cleaning: GRIT Framework Toolkit for Refreshing Your Digital Life

## Refresh Your Digital Life with Neurodivergent-Friendly Tools

Does your digital life feel cluttered, overwhelming, or out of control? You're not alone. Many of us struggle with digital chaos—hundreds of open tabs, scattered files, forgotten subscriptions, and digital spaces that drain our energy instead of supporting our creativity.

Our [Digital Spring Cleaning resource](/digital-spring-cleaning) is a comprehensive toolkit designed to help you refresh your digital life using the GRIT framework (Passion, Perseverance, Growth, Resilience). This free resource provides practical tools and frameworks that work with your unique brain patterns.

## What You'll Find in the Digital Spring Cleaning Toolkit

The toolkit includes everything you need to transform your relationship with technology:

### Digital Spring Cleaning Worksheet (PDF)

A comprehensive 4-page resource designed to be partially or fully filled out monthly or quarterly. Use it to:

- **Reflect** on your current digital environment
- **Set goals** for your digital wellness
- **Simplify** your digital world
- **Track progress** using the GRIT framework

The worksheet is available in two formats:
- **PDF Download:** Print it out or fill it digitally
- **Interactive Canva Template:** Customize it to fit your needs

**No sign-up required**—just download and start using it immediately.

### The GRIT Framework

Adapted from Angela Duckworth's groundbreaking research, the GRIT framework helps you build:

- **Passion:** Identifying what truly energizes you in your digital life
- **Perseverance:** Building sustainable habits that last
- **Growth:** Learning from your digital experiences
- **Resilience:** Bouncing back from digital overwhelm

This framework transforms digital spring cleaning from a one-time task into an ongoing practice of digital wellness.

### NAA Framework: Notice, Adjust, Acknowledge

The NAA Framework is a two-minute micro-reflection designed to help you quickly regain control and clarity in your digital life:

1. **Notice:** Pause and scan your digital environment. What feels energizing? What feels draining?
2. **Adjust:** Make one small change—close a tab, silence a notification, or move a distracting icon.
3. **Acknowledge:** Give yourself credit for taking intentional action, no matter how small.

This quick framework helps you make small, sustainable changes that compound over time.

## Why Digital Spring Cleaning Matters

Your digital environment directly impacts your:

- **Energy Levels:** Cluttered digital spaces drain mental energy
- **Productivity:** Disorganization makes it harder to find what you need
- **Creativity:** Digital chaos interrupts creative flow
- **Wellbeing:** Overwhelming digital spaces contribute to stress and anxiety

The Digital Spring Cleaning toolkit helps you create digital spaces that support rather than drain you.

## The GRIT Framework in Action

The toolkit applies Angela Duckworth's GRIT framework to digital wellness:

**Passion (P):**
- What digital tools bring you joy?
- Which platforms support your goals?
- What technology aligns with your values?

**Perseverance (P):**
- Building consistent digital habits
- Maintaining organization over time
- Sticking with systems that work

**Growth (G):**
- Learning from digital experiences
- Adapting systems as you grow
- Building on what works

**Resilience (R):**
- Bouncing back from digital overwhelm
- Recovering from tech failures
- Maintaining digital wellness during stress

## Monthly or Quarterly Reflection

The worksheet is designed to be used monthly or quarterly, making digital spring cleaning a sustainable practice rather than a one-time event. This approach:

- **Prevents Overwhelm:** Regular small cleanings are more manageable than annual overhauls
- **Builds Habits:** Consistent reflection creates lasting change
- **Tracks Progress:** You can see how your digital life improves over time
- **Adapts to Change:** Regular check-ins help you adjust as your needs change
