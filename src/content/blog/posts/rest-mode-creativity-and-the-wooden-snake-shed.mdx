# Rest Mode: Creativity, Organization, and the Wooden Snake's Final Shed

## "This pause without personal obligation has been transformative."

Hey there, cosmic coders and fellow rest-seekers.

If you've visited my homepage or about page recently, you've seen that I'm currently in **Rest Mode**—a period of rest and reflection that follows the ancient tradition of the Pythia Oracles of Delphi. Services resume March 2026, and I want to share what this intentional pause has actually meant for me.

What happens when you allow yourself an official pause without personal obligation? When you give yourself permission to rest, reflect, and create without the pressure of client deadlines or business expectations?

And honestly? It's been more productive than I expected, just not in the ways I thought it would be.

## What Rest Mode Actually Means

Rest Mode for me means no client work, no consulting sessions, no pressure to be "on" for anyone else. It's a period from November through March where I honor cycles of rest and renewal—partly because of chronic illness and chronic pain management, and partly because I've learned that creativity needs space to breathe. 

But here's what I didn't expect: **this pause has been incredibly productive in ways that have nothing to do with traditional productivity metrics.**

I've watched myself naturally gravitate toward work that matters—not because I have to, but because I want to. And that shift? It's been everything.

## The Organizational Pursuits: Scanning, Shredding, and Making Sense

One of the most satisfying things I've done during this Rest Mode? Scanning and shredding tons of "important documents" and receipts.

I'm talking about years of paper clutter that I'd been holding onto "just in case." Receipts from 2018. Documents I thought I might need someday. Papers that felt important but were actually just taking up physical and mental space.

But here's the real story: scanning all my medical receipts and documents finally helped me make sense of my 10-year battle with chronic pain. Finally putting all the pieces together to tell my story in a way that shows the full arc: after needing to quit my job to be bedridden for 9 months in 2018, getting into the spa and wellness space to grow and heal, and now I'm passing technical interviews as a senior software engineer.

Even though I can build a website from scratch, sometimes doing the manual labor of data collection can be just as meditative and insightful as the more mental work. There's something about the physical act of organizing, scanning, and digitizing that lets my brain process things differently. It's like the movement and the methodical nature of it creates space for insights I wouldn't have had if I'd just been thinking about it.

There's something deeply satisfying about the process: scanning what actually matters, digitizing it properly, and then watching the shredder turn the rest into confetti. It's a physical manifestation of applying the Wooden Snake's patience principle—observing what I've been holding onto, then letting go of what no longer serves to make space for what does.

I've been doing this in small batches, not rushing through it. That's been key. When I try to do it all at once, I get overwhelmed and stop. But when I do a little bit at a time, it feels manageable. Sustainable. Like something I can actually finish.

## Six Months of Daily Bullet Journaling: A Beautiful Space for Reflection

The past six months of daily bullet journal usage has given me a beautiful space to reflect on the past year of wooden snake skin shed.

If you've been following along, you know I wrote about the [Wooden Snake year in my Lunar New Year post](/blog/lunar-new-year-2025) - about how 2025 was a year of patience, adaptability, and quiet transformation. Well, my bullet journal has become the physical record of that transformation.

Every day, I've been tracking not just tasks, but reflections. Patterns. What's working. What's not. What I'm letting go of. What I'm making space for.

The journal has become a witness to this year of shedding—of leaving platforms (as I wrote about in my [TikTok boycott post](/blog/off-tiktok-for-good-tech-ethics-and-boundaries)), setting boundaries, making political choices about where I show up digitally. It's all there, in ink and paper, a record of a year that's been about quiet transformation rather than loud announcements.

I honestly love using this journal to help me see patterns I might otherwise miss. It's been a gamechanger actually—having a physical space to reflect on what's working and what's not, without the pressure of making it look perfect or shareable.

## Revamping Old Projects, Starting New Ones

Here's the thing about Rest Mode: when you remove the pressure of client obligations, you create space for your own creative work to breathe.

I've been revamping old projects that I'd set aside when client work took priority. Projects that felt too personal or too experimental to work on when I had deadlines to meet. Projects that needed time to percolate.

I've also been starting new ones. Ideas that have been brewing in the back of my mind, waiting for the right moment. Concepts that needed space to develop without the pressure of immediate deliverables.

My first project I revamped? The Surviving Capitalism Deck—a deck of cards I've been developing that applies 52 business and systems thinking principles to personal life, teaching everything from financial literacy to critical thinking through a gamified, collectible system. It's been sitting there, waiting. And now, without the pressure of client deadlines, I've been able to see it with fresh eyes—to understand what it actually needs to be, not what I thought it should be.

I'll be launching it as a digital product this year. And I'm gearing up for launching several other projects when my pause is over in March and I go back into more of a "business mode." But here's the key: these aren't projects I'm rushing to finish. They're projects that have had time to develop, to evolve, to become what they're meant to be—applying the Wooden Snake's principle of finding smarter paths forward by giving ideas the space they need to fully form.

## The Wooden Snake's Final Shed

This Rest Mode feels like the Wooden Snake's final shed—the culmination of a year of quiet transformation.

Looking back at my [Lunar New Year post](/blog/lunar-new-year-2025), I wrote about how 2025 was going to be a year of shedding old skin. And that's exactly what it's been. Leaving platforms. Setting boundaries. Making choices that align with my values, even when they're inconvenient.

This Rest Mode has given me the space to reflect on all of that. To see the patterns. To understand what I've learned. To prepare for what comes next.

Applying the Wooden Snake's patience principle, I've been able to observe this entire year of transformation before judging what it means or rushing to the next thing. That observation time? It's been essential.

## What This Means for March 2026

When services resume in March, I'll be coming back with:

- **Clarity** from six months of daily reflection
- **Organization** from the physical and digital decluttering I've done
- **Renewed energy** from honoring my body's need for rest
- **New projects** that have had time to develop properly
- **Revamped old projects** that are ready for a fresh start

But more than that, I'll be coming back with a deeper understanding of what sustainable service looks like. Of how rest isn't a limitation—it's essential for the quality of work I want to provide.

I've learned that the best creative work happens when I'm not forcing it. When I give ideas space to breathe, they become what they're meant to be—not what I think they should be.

## For Those Who Need Permission to Rest

If you're reading this and thinking, "I wish I could take a pause like that," I want you to know: **you have permission to rest.**

Maybe you can't take months off. But can you take a day? A weekend? Can you create boundaries around when you're available and when you're not? Can you give yourself space to reflect, to organize, to create without pressure?

The Wooden Snake teaches us that transformation happens in quiet moments. In the spaces between. In the pauses that feel unproductive but are actually essential. Applying its patience principle, we observe what we need before rushing to the next thing—and sometimes what we need is rest.

## Moving Forward

Rest Mode isn't forever. March 2026 is coming, and I'm excited to return to client work with renewed energy and clarity.

But I'm also committed to maintaining this rhythm—to honoring cycles of rest and renewal, to creating space for creativity to breathe, to recognizing that sustainable service requires sustainable practices.

Here's to rest. To reflection. To the quiet transformation that happens when we give ourselves permission to pause.

Keep your code clean, your boundaries clear, and your rest periods sacred.

Yours in algorithms and accountability,
