# I'm Off TikTok For Good: A Political Boycott and the Final Snake Skin Shed

## "I've deleted all my TikTok accounts. And I'm not coming back."

Hey there, cosmic coders and digital boundary-setters.

I've deleted my TikTok accounts completely. All of them. And I'm not coming back.

This isn't a spur-of-the-moment decision. It's been brewing for a while, part of a larger pattern of digital decluttering and boundary-setting that I've been working through. Just like I did with all of Meta's platforms, TikTok is now in my rearview mirror.

## The Boycott: Why This Is Political

I've made a conscious decision: **I will never support—and I'm actively boycotting—tech produced or owned by Larry Ellison, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and/or financed by Jared Kushner.**

This is a political choice. In 2026, unfortunately, it has to be. This isn't about being performative or virtue-signaling. It's about aligning my digital presence with my values and recognizing that every platform we use, every service we engage with, every click and view we generate contributes to something. And I've decided I need to be more intentional about what I'm contributing to.

As someone who works in tech and creates content about digital wellness, I've learned that our relationship with technology isn't neutral. The platforms we choose to engage with, the tools we recommend, the spaces where we build community—they all carry weight. They all have political implications.

## Why This Matters Now

When I deleted all my Meta accounts, it was part of a larger digital spring cleaning. A shedding of platforms that no longer served me or aligned with my values. TikTok feels like the next logical step in this ongoing process.

But this isn't just about leaving platforms. It's about recognizing that we have agency in our digital lives. We can choose where we spend our attention, where we build community, and what we're willing to support with our engagement.

Every platform we leave creates space for something else. Every boundary we set makes room for more intentional connection. Every "no" to a platform that doesn't align with our values is a "yes" to something that might.

## The LinkedIn Question

And honestly? I'm really tempted to include LinkedIn in my final purge and final skin shed of this metaphorical wooden snake year.

LinkedIn has always felt like a necessary evil for professional networking, but the more I think about it, the more I question whether it's actually necessary. The platform's algorithm, its engagement patterns, its role in professional culture—it all feels increasingly misaligned with how I want to show up in the world.

## When Even Your Relaxation Gets Complicated

Here's the thing that really drives home how pervasive this problem has become: my usual Sims 4 relaxation has also been in limbo because of these same people.

Electronic Arts, the company behind The Sims, is set to be acquired in 2027 by a group that includes Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners—the same firm that's been making deals backed by Saudi billions. The same pattern. The same people. Holding all the cards.

It's not just social media platforms. It's not just professional tools. It's the games I play to unwind. The spaces where I find joy and relaxation. More and more of the same people are holding all the cards, and it's getting harder to find spaces that aren't connected to them.

## Acknowledging Privilege

I want to be clear: **being able to boycott is a privilege I have, and I will continue to uphold it while I still can.**

Not everyone can walk away from these platforms. Not everyone has the financial stability, the professional flexibility, or the social safety net to make these choices. I recognize that. I'm not here to judge anyone who needs to stay on these platforms for work, for community, for survival.

But I do have this privilege. And I will continue to use it. As more and more of the same people consolidate power across tech, media, and entertainment, I will keep making choices that align with my values, even when it means giving up things I love.

## What This Means Practically

For those of you who followed me on TikTok, I'm sorry if this feels abrupt. But I hope you'll understand that this is part of a larger journey toward more intentional digital living.

You can still find me on:
- **Bluesky** - where I'm building community in a more open, decentralized space
- **YouTube** - for longer-form content and tutorials
- **GitHub** - for code and technical work
- **This blog** - for deeper reflections and resources

## The Wooden Snake Year: Shedding What No Longer Serves

This year has been about shedding. Letting go of what no longer serves. Setting boundaries that feel right, even when they're uncomfortable. Making choices that align with my values, even when they're inconvenient.

Leaving TikTok feels like part of that shedding. Part of the process of becoming more intentional about where I show up, what I support, and how I engage with the digital world.

## For Those Considering Similar Moves

If you're thinking about leaving platforms or setting similar boundaries, here's what I've learned:

1. **It's okay to change your mind** - What served you before might not serve you now. That's growth.
2. **Boundaries are personal** - Your boundaries don't have to match mine or anyone else's. What matters is that they feel right for you.
3. **Community finds a way** - When you leave one platform, you find new ways to connect. The community that matters will follow you to spaces that align with your values.
4. **It's an ongoing process** - Digital decluttering isn't a one-time event. It's an ongoing practice of checking in with yourself about what serves you.

## Moving Forward

I'm not here to tell anyone else what to do. This is my choice, my boundary, my way of aligning my digital presence with my values.

But I am here to say: **You have agency in your digital life.** You can choose where you show up. You can set boundaries. You can boycott platforms that don't serve you or align with your values.

And if you're doing similar work—questioning platforms, setting boundaries, doing your own digital decluttering—I see you. This work matters.

Here's to more intentional digital living. To boundaries that feel right. To shedding what no longer serves us. And to building community in spaces that align with our values.

Keep your code clean, your boundaries clear, and your values aligned.

Yours in algorithms and accountability,
