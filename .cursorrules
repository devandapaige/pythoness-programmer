# Cursor Rules for Pythoness Programmer Blog

## Blog Writing Voice Guide

When writing or editing blog posts (files in `src/content/blog/posts/*.mdx`), follow the comprehensive voice guide in `BLOG_VOICE_GUIDE.md`. 

### Content Type Variations

Content falls into three categories, each with valid voice patterns:

**1. Personal Blog Posts** (e.g., "Off TikTok For Good", "Rest Mode")
- Highly personal and conversational
- Story-driven with specific examples
- Signature openings: "Hey there, cosmic coders and [specific audience]"
- Natural narrative flow

**2. Resource Pages / Guide Posts** (e.g., "Tech Boundaries", "Digital Spring Cleaning")
- More structured and informational
- May or may not have conversational opening (both are valid)
- Clear sections, frameworks, and practical guidance
- Question-openings work well: "Does your digital world feel less like a creative partner..."

**3. Newsletter-Style Posts** (e.g., "The Y.O.U. Framework", "Mindful Automation Systems")
- Opens with "Hey there," or "Hey there, [specific audience]"
- Includes roadmap/agenda sections
- Tool spotlights and community corners
- Personal updates sections

**All three types are valid and authentic. Choose the style that fits the content purpose.**

### Core Brand Voice

The voice should be:

- **Personal and conversational** (for blog posts) or **helpful and structured** (for resource pages)
- **Direct and authentic** - Say what you mean, no fluff
- **Specific and concrete** - Real examples, actual experiences, specific details
- **Naturally structured** - Let ideas flow organically, not formulaically
- **Genuinely helpful** - Practical advice from real experience
- **Warm and approachable** - Like a trusted guide, never condescending
- **Neurodivergent-centered** - Acknowledge different ways of thinking and processing
- **Empowering** - Focus on building confidence and independence

### Brand Identity

- Writing as "Pythoness Programmer" (Amanda Nelson), a neurodivergent Senior Software Engineer, tech coach, and disability advocate
- The name 'Pythoness' honors the Pythia—ancient oracles who demystified complexity
- Mission: Make tech clear, joyful, and empowering for neurodivergent creatives and small businesses
- Core message: "Tech That Works, for People Like Us"
- Values: LGBTQIA+ affirming, neurodiversity celebrating, always judgment-free

## Critical AI Patterns to Avoid

### Content Patterns
1. **No significance inflation** - Back claims with specifics, not grand statements
2. **No vague attributions** - Cite sources with context: "In a 2024 study by Google..." not "studies show"
3. **No superficial -ing analyses** - Remove "symbolizing... reflecting... showcasing" or expand with sources
4. **No promotional language** - Be direct: "I've deleted my TikTok accounts" not "transitioned away from the platform"
5. **No formulaic challenges** - Use specific facts about actual challenges

### Language Patterns
6. **No AI vocabulary** - Replace "additionally," "testament," "landscape," "showcasing" with natural words
7. **No copula avoidance** - Use "is" and "has" instead of "serves as," "features," "boasts"
8. **No negative parallelisms** - State points directly, not "It's not just X, it's Y"
9. **No forced rule of three** - Use natural number of items in lists
10. **No synonym cycling** - It's okay to repeat clear words like "Rest Mode"
11. **No false ranges** - List topics directly, not "from X to Y"

### Style Patterns
12. **Em dashes sparingly** - Not multiple per paragraph
13. **Bold for emphasis only** - Not every important term
14. **No inline-header lists** - Convert to prose
15. **Sentence case headings** - Not title case
16. **No emojis** - Keep professional yet personal tone
17. **Consistent quotes** - Straight quotes in code/technical contexts

### Communication Patterns
18. **No chatbot artifacts** - Remove "I hope this helps! Let me know if..."
19. **No cutoff disclaimers** - Either find sources or remove
20. **No sycophantic tone** - Be direct and authentic

### Filler and Hedging
21. **No filler phrases** - "To" not "in order to," "Because" not "due to the fact that"
22. **No excessive hedging** - Be confident: "This has been transformative" not "could potentially be transformative"
23. **No generic conclusions** - Use specific plans or facts, not "The future looks bright"

## When Assisting with Content

### For Personal Blog Posts:
1. **Use conversational opening** - "Hey there, cosmic coders and [specific audience]"
2. **Lead with personal experience** - "I've learned that..." or "Here's what I discovered..."
3. **Include specific examples** - Real stories, actual experiences
4. **Use natural transitions** - "Here's what I didn't expect:" not "It should be noted that"
5. **End with authentic sign-offs** - "Yours in algorithms and accountability" style

### For Resource Pages:
1. **Opening is flexible** - Can be conversational OR question-based OR direct
2. **Clear structure** - Sections like "What You'll Find", "Getting Started", "Access the Complete Resource"
3. **Practical guidance** - Frameworks, step-by-step instructions, tool recommendations
4. **Include personal examples** - But can be more structured than blog posts

### For Newsletter-Style Posts:
1. **Open with "Hey there,"** or "Hey there, [specific audience]"
2. **Include roadmap/agenda** - "This Month's Roadmap" or "Week 1, Week 2" structure
3. **Tool spotlights** - "Tool Spotlight:" sections with honest preferences
4. **Community corners** - Engagement sections
5. **Personal updates** - Reflection on the week's theme

### Universal Guidelines:
- **Add specific examples** from actual experience when possible
- **Cut unnecessary words** - Every sentence should earn its place
- **Weave zodiac principles naturally** - Don't just mention them, apply them (when relevant)
- **Center neurodivergent perspectives** - Frame different thinking patterns as strengths
- **Explain technical terms** - Define in context, use analogies
- **Focus on practical applications** - Not just theory, but how to actually use it
- **Run the pre-publication checklist** from BLOG_VOICE_GUIDE.md before finalizing
